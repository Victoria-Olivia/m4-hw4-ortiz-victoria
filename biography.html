            <h2>The Early Years </h2>
            <p>Leonardo DaVinci is one of the most celebrated artists of the Renaissance era. DaVinci began his artistic journey in Florence, Italy. Born 1452 in Vinci, a small town near Florence, he showed an early aptitude for drawing and observation. At 14, Leonardo became an apprentice to Andrea del Verrocchio, a renowned painter and sculptor. He learned essential artistic techniques, including painting, sculpture, and mechanical arts. During his apprenticeship, Leonardo contributed to several of Verrocchio’s works, most notably The Baptism of Christ, in which it is believed he painted the angel on the left with such skill that Verrocchio allegedly decided never to paint again (one of life’s many mysteries). Leonardo’s keen eye for detail, innovative use of perspective, and fascination with human anatomy began to set him apart from his generation. By the late 1470s, DaVinici had established himself as an independent artist. He received commissions in Florence and later moved to Milan, where he would create some of his most iconic works. His early experiences as an apprentice laid the foundation for his mastery of art and lifelong pursuit of knowledge across multiple disciplines.<a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ZuLvRD16qWMC&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=Leonardo+Da+Vinci&ots=5ByJvo9Czf&sig=0q7kzQYgvTTN-GBAqsFQ84S9-VE#v=onepage&q=Leonardo%20Da%20Vinci&f=false">Read more about Leonardo DaVinci’s life.</a></p>
