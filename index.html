            <h2>Fun Fact:</h2>
            <p>So nobody could steal his ideas, Leonardo DaVinci invented a secret way of writing in his journal; the only way to decipher the notes was with a mirror. It makes you wonder what other secrets DaVinci wasn’t ready to reveal. After all, he was ahead of his time; perhaps he felt the world wasn’t prepared. It was even rumored that DaVinci sabotaged one of his weapon machines that could someday destroy any country’s enemies. Still, he thought something this powerful might fall into the wrong hands and never finished the machine.</p>
